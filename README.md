## Description

This application will allow a user use a sign up form

Once the sign up procedure is completed a post request will be made to
`https://demo-api.now.sh/users` containing the firstName, lastName and email fields.

```
{
  firstName: "Thomas",
  lastName: "Shelby",
  email: "thomas@shelby.co.uk"
}
```

The results of the request will be shown in json format on the screen.

If an error occurs the error will be logged to the console.

Signing up requires the user to enter a password that meets the following criteria:

- Should be a minimum of eight characters,
- Should contain lower and uppercase letters,
- Should not contain userâ€™s first or last name.
